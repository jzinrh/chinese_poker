* new features
- drag/drop hand order (e.g. modify order of player.get('hand')
- validation on join button in registration view
  - should require game code and user name to look enabled
- make user accounts to prevent (really easy) cheating
- button styling on registration, should probably just... completely redo player_status/registration

* polish (there should be a lot here, but i'm lazy with todos)
- remove pass other button

* infrastructure/test
- template.js should auto-convert models to hashes
- write tests that extend game model (e.g. deal out straight flushes and stuff), pass in args through start-up (e.g. node server.js --test myTestCase)
- convert site/js/lib to npm modules, use browserfy to create a single bundle of lib js, remove those lib things from the require statements ( they should be available globally? )
- configure node require to include site/js
- create a template for game log view
- Add server side validation for playing cards
- don't re-render entire game log every time someone makes a play
- 5 card hand display should look better
